# pixel-tile-maker
A weekend project to create a builder for pixel-style tilesets and backgrounds. 
I started this project after seeing these two big inspirations:
- [Coding Quickie: Isometric Tiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukkbNKTgf5U&list=WL&index=21)
- [Isomer](https://jdan.github.io/isomer/)  

It's in the very early implementation, a POC, and my goal is to be able to also create isometric tiles or worlds.
During implemetation, it became cumbersome to update states, data binding, and styling without any frameworks, so that's the next step to do.
